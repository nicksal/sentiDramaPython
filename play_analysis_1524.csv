639,639,ACT 3,KING.," Thanks, dear my lord. [_Exit Polonius._]O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven; It hath the primal eldestcurse upon’t,— A brother’s murder! Pray can I not, Though inclinationbe as sharp as will: My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent, And,like a man to double business bound, I stand in pause where I shallfirst begin, And both neglect. What if this cursed hand Were thickerthan itself with brother’s blood, Is there not rain enough in the sweetheavens To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy But to confrontthe visage of offence? And what’s in prayer but this twofold force, Tobe forestalled ere we come to fall, Or pardon’d being down? Then I’lllook up. My fault is past. But O, what form of prayer Can serve myturn? Forgive me my foul murder! That cannot be; since I am stillpossess’d Of those effects for which I did the murder,— My crown, mineown ambition, and my queen. May one be pardon’d and retain th’offence?In the corrupted currents of this world Offence’s gilded hand may shoveby justice, And oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law.But ’tis not so above; There is no shuffling, there the action lies Inhis true nature, and we ourselves compell’d Even to the teeth andforehead of our faults, To give in evidence. What then? What rests? Trywhat repentance can. What can it not? Yet what can it, when one cannotrepent? O wretched state! O bosom black as death! O limed soul, thatstruggling to be free, Art more engag’d! Help, angels! Make assay: Bow,stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel, Be soft as sinews ofthe new-born babe. All may be well.
